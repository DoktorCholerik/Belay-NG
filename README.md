# Belay Next Gen Variants for Kalico 
*Filament buffer with active feed ‚Äî two variants: Dual‚ÄëSensor & Linear Potentiometer*

> **TL;DR:**  
> Belay decouples the hotend extruder from the filament feed at the spool side.  
> A second, synchronized extruder feeds a buffer ("Belay").  
> Sensors measure the buffer position and dynamically adjust the Belay ratio ‚Üí smoother flow, less under/over‚Äëpressure, and more stable extrusion at high speeds.

## Features
- **Two operating modes:**
  - **Dual‚ÄëSensor:** Two optical endstops (LOW/HIGH) define buffer zones ‚Üí Belay speeds up, slows down, or stays neutral.
  - **Linear Potentiometer:** Analog position measurement ‚Üí continuous adjustment of the Belay ratio.
- **Firmware‚Äëintegrated** (Kalico): Ratio control via Belay.py
- **Quick tuning:** Easily adjust thresholds, hysteresis, and ratio curves.

## How it works

### Principle
- **Two extruders in firmware:**
  - `extruder`: the standard hotend extruder.
  - `extruder_stepper belay`: located before the spool, after the buffer. It is **synchronized** with the main extruder, but with an adjustable **ratio**.
- **Buffer** (Bowden/PTFE loop) stores filament length.
- **Sensor system** measures buffer position:
  - **Dual‚ÄëSensor:**  
    - **LOW** (under‚Äëfill) ‚Üí Belay **faster** (ratio > 1.0).  
    - **MID** (OK) ‚Üí Belay **neutral** (‚âà1.0).  
    - **HIGH** (over‚Äëfill) ‚Üí Belay **slower** (ratio < 1.0). 
  - **Linear potentiometer:**  
    - Analog value (0‚Äì100‚ÄØ%) is mapped via a curve to the ratio (e.g. 0.8‚Äì1.2) ‚Üí **continuous** regulation.
    - >**WIP**

### Advantages
- Less load fluctuation on the hotend extruder.
- Better layer consistency at high accelerations.
- Fewer filament slips with tight or sticky spools.
- Bigger spools possible without challaging the main extruder - printing with ease.

## Mechanics (short overview)
- **Dual‚ÄëSensor:** Two optical endstops (LOW & HIGH) mounted so the MID zone is wide enough.
- **Linear Potentiometer:** 10‚ÄØkŒ© linear potentiometer, mechanically coupled to the buffer (slider or lever).

> **Tip:** Strain‚Äërelieve cables, shield optical sensors from ambient light, and protect potentiometer from dust.

## Example wiring (pins)
- **MCU pins (from one build):**  
  - `PA14` ‚Üí **HIGH** (over‚Äëfill)  
  - `PA15` ‚Üí **LOW** (under‚Äëfill)  
- **Potentiometer version:**  
  - Wiper ‚Üí MCU analog input (ADC)
  - Every ADC port works, thermistor port is recommended solution.

> Pins, pull‚Äëups, and invert settings depend on your board and sensors ‚Äì verify using `QUERY_BUTTON`/`QUERY_ENDSTOPS` or ADC debug.
